                        <p class="inner-paragraph-justify">The main benefits of bullet cameras are their range and installation. Bullet cameras have a longer range which makes them ideal for viewing large areas like backyards and parking lots. Also, bullet cameras are easier to install, and due to the shape of the bullet camera bigger lenses can be fitted to its body. Ideal for outdoor use, the tip of the bullet camera includes a small lip which helps protect against glare and weather.

                           <p class="inner-paragraph-justify">Dome Security Cameras are named for their dome-like shape. Dome cameras are commonly used in surveillance systems inside of homes, casinos, retail stores, and restaurants. This is because dome cameras are more fashionable and blend in very well with their surroundings. Because of their dome shape, it is difficult for someone to tell which direction the lens of a Dome Camera is actually aiming. When shopping for a Dome Camera, you should consider if you need night vision, in which case you should look at an infrared dome camera.</p>
